# Ollama Deepseek-r1 (7b) Sample

## Prompt:

There are 49 dogs signed up for a dog show. There are 36 more small dogs than large dogs. How many small dogs have signed up to compete?

## Ollama Response: 

`<think>`
First, I recognize that there are a total of 49 dogs signed up for the dog show.

Letâ€™s denote the number of large dogs as L and the number of small dogs as S.

According to the problem, there are 36 more small dogs than large dogs. This can be expressed as:
S = L + 36

Since the total number of dogs is 49, I can set up the equation:
L + S = 49

Substituting the expression for S from the first equation into the second equation gives:
L + (L + 36) = 49

Simplifying this equation results in:
2L + 36 = 49

Subtracting 36 from both sides:
2L = 13

Dividing both sides by 2:
L = 6.5

However, since the number of dogs should be a whole number, there seems to be an inconsistency.

To resolve this, I'll reevaluate my initial assumptions and calculations to identify any possible errors.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total number of dogs = 49
- Number of small dogs \( S \) is **36 more** than the number of large dogs \( L \).

So, we can write:
\[
S = L + 36
\]
And since the total number of dogs is 49:
\[
L + S = 49
\]

Now, substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
L + (L + 36) = 49
\]
Simplify:
\[
2L + 36 = 49
\]
Subtract 36 from both sides:
\[
2L = 13
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
L = \frac{13}{2} = 6.5
\]

Wait, having a fraction of a dog doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there's an inconsistency because the number of dogs should be whole numbers.

**Rechecking the Problem:**
It appears that the given information might contain a mistake since we're getting a non-integer value for \( L \). To have valid integer solutions, the difference between small and large dogs must result in an even total when added to the larger group. Let's adjust our approach accordingly.

Assuming there are 36 more small dogs than large ones:
\[
S = L + 36
\]
Total dogs:
\[
L + S = 49 \Rightarrow L + (L + 36) = 49 \\
2L + 36 = 49 \\
2L = 13 \\
L = 6.5
\]

Since \( L \) cannot be a fraction, there must be an error in the problem statement or our interpretation.

**Alternative Interpretation:**
Suppose the difference is **smaller** by 36 dogs:
\[
S = L - 36
\]
But this leads to negative numbers if \( S > L \), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the original problem likely contains a typo or requires additional constraints.

Given the information provided, we cannot find integer values for \( L \) and \( S \).

However, based on the initial equations:
\[
S = 6.5 + 36 = 42.5
\]
Again, this results in non-integer values.

Since fractional dogs aren't possible, there's likely an error in the problem statement.

**Final Answer:**
There seems to be **no valid solution** with the given information since it results in a fractional number of dogs.

\(\boxed{\text{No valid solution}}\)
